DEBIAN / UBUNTU USERS
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF INSTALLING FROM THE OFFICIAL
REPOSITORIES - see http://www.openmolar.com/om1/installation

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get openMolar running from source, please follow these instructions

openmolar requires a python3 runtime, qt4 for python3 and a python3 wrapper around the c-api for
communicating with the database, along with a few other utilities. These are all
available for most recent gnu/linux operating systems, and also for microsoft
windows.
You also need a mysql or mariadb database server running on your network, or on
the client machine for a standalone test.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By way of example, I will give instructions for installing these dependencies on debian testing. 
    On other operating systems, you need to install the equivalent software
    before running openmolar for the first time.

    ##CLIENT MACHINE##
    ensure depenencies are met on the client machine

    ~$ sudo apt-get install python3-mysqldb python3-qt4 python3-pyqt4.qsci xdg-utils


    ##SERVER MACHINE##
    ensure dependencies are met on the server machine (which will probably be the same machine as your client 
    for testing purposes, providing a service on "localhost")

    ~$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
    OR
    ~$ sudo apt-get install mariadb-server

    MAKE A CAREFUL NOTE OF THE PASSWORD YOU SET UP FOR THE ROOT MYSQL-USER. 
    YOU CANNOT CREATE A DATABASE WITHOUT THIS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Once you have prepared your machine/network in this way, You are ready to try openmolar

navigate into the "src" directory and type
~$ python3 main.py

on first run of openMolar, you set a password for the app, you are given an opportunity to install a test database.


NB - The test database is currently very limited with only 1 patient. (serial no 1)
But The app will not run without it!


the test database has one operator - "user". 
So when prompted, enter the system password you just set up, and put "user" into the user1 field.


if you wish to re-initiate your settings at any point, delete the file
~/.openmolar/openmolar.conf, to trigger the setup wizard again, alternatively edit this file (with care)


if / when you are ready to install, type

~$ python setup.py install

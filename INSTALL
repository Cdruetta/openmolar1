system rather than using setup.py yourself.

If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy the dependencies 
for openmolar

 * Python 2.5+  (not 3.0+)
 * Python-qt4
 * Python mySQLdb 

Also, you need to have a running mysql server, locally or on your network.

To install properly, run:

    ./setup.py install

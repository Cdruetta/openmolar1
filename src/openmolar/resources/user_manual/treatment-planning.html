<h1>Openmolar User Manual</h1>
<h4>What does openmolar do when I add an item of treatment to a patient's treatment plan.</h4>


<ol>
<li>
    Openmolar checks that the patient has an active treatment course, 
    and gets the user to verify which clinician is responsible for that course.<br />
    If no active course is in place (or started at this prompt, the process is abandoned.<br />
    <a href="#active-course">Appendix i - What is an active course?</a>
</li>

<li>
    As an example, let's assume you are adding a small xray.<br />
    For this item the treatment shortcut is "S" <a href="#shortcut">Appendix ii - What is a shortcut?</a><br />
</li>

<li>
    At this point the feescales are checked to get a price for this treatment. 
    <a href="#feescales">Appendix iii - feescales</a><br />
   
    (ie. A key lookup for "xray S" is done.)<br />
    At this point there are 3 possibilities.
    <ul>
        <li>The code matches an item in the patient's default feescale.
            <a href="#default-feescale">Appendix iv - default feescale</a><br />
            When this occurs, an estimate item is created, using the description and price provided by the item.
        </li>
    
        <li>The code matches an item in another feescale. <br />
            This can happen, for instance with some items that are only provided privately.<br />
            Large white fillings in posterior teeth, for instance.<br />
            If this occurs, the user is prompted for approval before the code is accepted and estimate generated from the 
            alternate item.
        </li>
    
        <li>The code is not found in any feescale.<br />
            If this is the case, the user is warned, and asked what to do.<br />
            Should this shortcut be used on the treatment plan, 
            and an estimate item generated which refers to "other treatment"?
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>

</ol>


If we have got this far without the user chosing to abandon, we will have both a shortcut and an esimate object.<br />
It is time to apply these.<br />
<ul>
    <li>An "S" and a space is  appended to the treatment plan's xray attribute. 
        <a href="#attribute">Appendix v - What is an attribute?</a>
    </li>
    <li>This estimate is appended to the patients list of estimates.</li>
    <li>The user interfaces displaying this information are updated.
</ul>

<dt id="active-course">
i: What is an active course?
</dt>
<dd>
An active course responds to a single data row with a unique id. 
Until that id is set, there is nowhere to save the treatment plan data. 
</dd>

<dt id="shortcut">
ii: What is a shortcut?
</dt>
<dd>
A shortcut is an abbreviation of the treatment being applied.<br />
Many are very common in dentistry, example "MOD" describes a specific thess surface filling.<br />
For non-filling items, shortcuts are less obvious.<br />
In fact, Openmolar allows heavy customisation of all these shortcuts, however consistency is key, and for historical reasons, in my practice, a small xray is "S", a medium xray is "M" a panoral xray is "P" and so on.<br />
Codes should be unique for each type of treatment (namely xray, perio, chart, denture, other etc.. ) and consistent across all <a href="feescales">feescales</a> in use.
</dd>

<dt id="feescales">
iii: What is a feescale?
</dt>
<dd>
A feescale is an xml document stored in the database.<br />
More information can be found at <a href="feescales.html">feescales.html</a> 
</dd>

<dt id="default-feescale">
iv: The patient has a default feescale?
</dt>
<dd>
Yes. Assuming your system has more than one feescale, when a record is loaded, or a new treatment course started, the best match is used a a default.<br />
Criteria used are contract type (example NHS, Private or Insurance Plan), patients age, and the date the treatment course commenced.
</dd>

<dt id="attribute">
v: What is an attribute?
</dt>
<dd>
An attribute is simply a computer science term for a property associated with an object in memory.<br />
In the case of a treatment plan, this attribute is a sequence of space separated characters.<br />
eg "2S P M " as an xray attribute would equate to 2 small, a panoral and a medium xray.
